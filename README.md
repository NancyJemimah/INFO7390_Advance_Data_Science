This repository consists of notebooks which can be used to play around to get an idea about the working knowledge of Reinforcement learning for the beginners who are interested in learning.

Added to that, there are articles created from scratch to understand what is reinforcement learning? and also covering all the terminologies. The main two algorithms explained in my last two articles are

* Q learning
* Deep Q Learning


1. https://medium.com/@nancyjemi/basics-reinforcement-learning-66aae5da4c85  - Basics concepts covered with the terminologies used in RL
2. https://medium.com/@nancyjemi/level-up-understanding-q-learning-cf739867eb1d - Q learning
3. https://medium.com/@nancyjemi/deep-q-learning-explained-65df980aac6f - Deep Q Learning Explained



Setup Procedures:

To start working on the notebook.
 * Install all the dependencies mentioned in the Requirements.txt
 * Check whether the openai gym and retro environments are working in the jupyter notebook
 * Then you can start playing around with the notebook
 
 Feel free to change different game environment from the openai gym (toy text, classic control, atari games)
