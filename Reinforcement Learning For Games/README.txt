Reinforcement Learning for Games:

This folder consists of the notebooks that are implemented
1. Q-learning ( Taxi Environment Included as well the baseline performance is improved )
2. Deep Q Learning ( CartPole and SpaceInvaders environment is implemented)

To run this notebook,

First we need to download the dependencies from the file Requirements.txt

Once the dependencies are downloaded, we can run our notebook.

To understand the concept I have create blogs on my own

3. https://medium.com/@nancyjemi/deep-q-learning-explained-65df980aac6f

The above links are given in the notebook

Topics Covered in the folders are
1. Terminologies used in the Reinforcement Learning
2. Q-learning Explained
3. Deep Q learning concepts

Conclusion:

As the model requires more GPU utlization, I would recommend the user to run the notebook in the 
GPU enabled environment. And also, I would like to add a note that the notebooks should be trained for
more number of epochs to get the better result.
